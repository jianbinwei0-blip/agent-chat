# Execution Plans

Execution plans are first-class repository artifacts.
Use this folder to keep active work context and historical decisions versioned with code.

## Layout

- `active/`: plans currently in progress
- `completed/`: finalized plans moved from `active/`
- `tech-debt-tracker.md`: known debt and follow-up opportunities

## Plan Template

Each plan should include:
- Objective and scope
- Acceptance criteria
- Current status
- Decision log (date + rationale)
- Validation notes (tests/checks run)

Use concise files and keep them updated as execution progresses.
